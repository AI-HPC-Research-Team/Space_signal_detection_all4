## Introduction

<p align="justify">
Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors will be able to observe signals from sources that are otherwise nearly impossible from current ground-based detection. Consequently, the well established signal detection method, matched filtering, will require a complex template bank, leading to a computational cost that is too expensive in practice. Here, we develop a high-accuracy GW signal detection and extraction method for all space-based GW sources. As a proof of concept, we show that a science-driven and uniform multi-stage deep neural network can identify synthetic signals that are submerged in Gaussian noise. Our method has more than 99% accuracy for signal detection of various sources while obtaining at least 95% similarity compared with target signals. We further demonstrate the interpretability and strong generalization behavior for several extended scenarios.

## Getting started

Our model is developed on top of the [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io/) toolkit. To set up the environment and install necessary dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Additionally, you need to install the [FastEMRIWaveform](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms) package to generate the EMRI dataset. Follow the instructions provided on their repository to complete the installation.

## Training the Model

To generate datasets for training, you can use the following functions in `gwdataset.py`:

```python
generate_emri_dataset()
generate_smbhb_dataset()
generate_bwd_dataset()
generate_sgwb_dataset()
generate_noise_dataset()
```

After generating the dataset, specify the path to the dataset folder and the dataset file names in the configuration file `se-mlp.yaml`:

```yaml
data_folder: path-to-dataset-folder
data_hdf5: dataset-file-name
noise_hdf5: pure-noise-dataset-file-name
```

Finally, train the model by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python train_se_mlp se-mlp.yaml
```
